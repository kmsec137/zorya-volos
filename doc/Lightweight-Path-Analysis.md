# Lightweight Path Analysis for Vulnerability Detection

## Overview

Zorya now includes **lightweight path analysis** to detect vulnerabilities (null pointer dereferences, division by zero, etc.) that don't involve explicit panic function calls. This is crucial for analyzing binaries compiled with compilers that rely on CPU traps rather than explicit panic calls.

## Problem Statement

Different compilers handle errors differently:

### TinyGo Compiler
```
if ptr == nil {
    runtime.nilpanic()  ← Explicit call, detected by panic reach analysis
}
```

### Go GC Compiler (Standard Go)
```
*ptr = value  ← If ptr==0, CPU triggers SIGSEGV
              ← OS delivers signal → runtime.sigpanic → panic
              ← No direct panic call in binary!
```

### C/C++ Compilers
```
*ptr = value  ← If ptr==0, segfault via OS
              ← No panic infrastructure at all
```


## Solution for the Go GC and C/C++ compilers: Lightweight Path Analysis

For every conditional branch involving symbolic variables, Zorya now:

1. **Takes the concrete path** (normal execution)
2. **Performs lightweight pattern-based scanning of the negated path** (up to N instructions)
3. **Checks for dangerous patterns without full state cloning**:
   - `LOAD [address]` where address could be 0 or symbolic → **NULL_DEREF_LOAD**
   - `STORE [address], value` where address could be 0 → **NULL_DEREF_STORE**
   - `DIV/REM` where divisor could be 0 → **DIV_BY_ZERO**
4. **Reports vulnerability** with constraint to trigger it
5. **Continues normal execution**

## Why "Lightweight"?

Traditional concolic execution would require:
- Cloning entire execution state (memory, registers, constraints)
- Actually executing instructions on the cloned state
- High memory and CPU overhead

Lightweight path analysis instead:
- **No state cloning** - reads current state but doesn't modify it
- **Pattern matching** - scans P-Code instructions for dangerous patterns
- **Zero-register tracking** - tracks which registers are known to be zero
- **Minimal memory overhead**

## Example: Detecting Null Pointer Dereference

### Source Code (Go)
```go
func crash(arg uint8) {
    if arg == 'K' {
        var x *int = nil
        *x = 0  // NULL DEREFERENCE!
    }
}
```

### Compiled Assembly
```asm
004b712c  CMP  AL, 0x4b        ; if arg == 'K'
004b712e  JZ   LAB_004b7132     ; jump to crash code

LAB_004b7132:
004b7132  MOV  qword ptr [RSP], 0x0   ; store nil pointer
004b713a  XOR  EAX, EAX                ; EAX = 0
004b713c  TEST byte ptr [RAX], AL      ; READ FROM [0x0] ← CRASH!
004b713e  MOV  qword ptr [RAX], 0x0    ; WRITE TO [0x0] ← CRASH!
```

### Zorya Execution Log (with input 'a')

  Symbolic: involves arg_RDI (tracked variable)

## Detected Vulnerability Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `NULL_DEREF_LOAD` | Reading from null pointer | `x = *ptr` where `ptr == 0` |
| `NULL_DEREF_STORE` | Writing to null pointer | `*ptr = val` where `ptr == 0` |
| `DIV_BY_ZERO` | Division by zero | `x / y` where `y == 0` |

## Implementation Details

The lightweight path analysis performs pattern matching on P-Code instructions:

```rust
// From lightweight_path_analysis.rs
pub fn lightweight_analyze_path<'ctx>(
    executor: &mut ConcolicExecutor<'ctx>,
    start_address: u64,
    instructions_map: &BTreeMap<u64, Vec<Inst>>,
    max_depth: usize,  // Default: 50 instructions
) -> LightweightAnalysisResult {
    // Track registers known to be zero
    let mut zero_registers = HashSet::new();
    
    // Scan instructions for dangerous patterns
    for inst in instructions {
        match inst.opcode {
            // Vulnerability patterns
            Opcode::Load => check_null_pointer_read(inst),
            Opcode::Store => check_null_pointer_write(inst),
            Opcode::IntDiv | Opcode::IntRem => check_division_by_zero(inst),
            
            // Control flow handling
            Opcode::Branch => follow_unconditional_jump(inst),
            Opcode::CBranch => follow_branch_target_only(inst),  // Limitation!
            Opcode::Call | Opcode::CallInd => follow_into_callee(inst),
            Opcode::Return => return Safe,
            
            _ => {}
        }
        
        // Update zero-tracking
        track_zero_registers(inst, &mut zero_registers);
    }
}
```

## Control Flow Handling

The lightweight path analysis handles different control flow instructions:

| P-Code Instruction | Behavior | Continues Analysis? |
|-------------------|----------|---------------------|
| **BRANCH** | Follows the jump target | Yes - continues at target address |
| **CBRANCH** | Follows branch target only | Partial - ignores fall-through path |
| **CALL** | Follows into the called function | Yes - continues at callee address |
| **CALLIND** | Follows into the called function | Yes - continues at callee address (if target is known) |
| **RETURN** | Treats as end of path | No - returns `Safe` |
| **Unknown target** | Cannot determine address | No - returns `DepthLimitReached` |

## Analysis Boundaries and Limitations

### What is Analyzed 
- **Single path execution** - Scans up to 50 instructions on the untaken branch
- **Null pointer dereferences** - LOAD and STORE operations with null addresses
- **Division by zero** - Integer division/remainder operations with zero divisor
- **Unconditional jumps** - Follows BRANCH instructions to continue scanning
- **Function calls** - Follows CALL and CALLIND into called functions (up to depth limit)
- **Zero register tracking** - Monitors registers known to be zero

### What is NOT Analyzed 

| Limitation | Reason | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Conditional branches (CBranch)** | Only follows branch target, ignores fall-through | May miss vulnerabilities on the other path |
| **Indirect jumps/calls** | Cannot determine dynamic targets | Stops analysis when target is unknown |
| **Depth limit (50 instructions)** | Prevents infinite loops and keeps analysis fast | May not reach vulnerabilities deep in call chains |
| **Return handling** | Returns end the analysis path | Cannot track multiple return paths |
| **Complex data flow** | No full symbolic execution | May miss vulnerabilities requiring complex constraints |

## When to Use

Lightweight path analysis is automatically enabled for:
- **Go GC binaries** - Detects implicit nil dereferences that don't have explicit panic calls
- **C/C++ binaries** - Detects segfaults and undefined behavior
- Any binary where implicit vulnerabilities exist without explicit error handling

Disabled for:
- **TinyGo binaries** - They insert explicit panic calls, so AST-based exploration is sufficient
